\chapter{A Concise Overview of A Python Regression Test Suite For a Web Application}
This thesis proposes a general-purpose python module for the implementation of high volume automated tests. To properly discuss the nuanced uses of the module, it is first critical to establish a "typical" industrial usage scenario.

To that end, this chapter describes the state of the art in the web test automation field, and walks through the construction of a web test suite for a popular open source relationship management site, Monica, available for use from the website \url{https://monicahq.org} as well for self-hosting from \url{https://github.com/monicahq/monica}. Later chapters will discuss implementation of the module for high volume long sequence regression testing as well as the industrial and academic context surrounding the practice of high volume automated testing.

The test suite discussed in this chapter is published in its entirety online at \url{https://github.com/elementc/monica-tests-traditional}. They are written against the 0.6.5 release of the Monica software, and may be run using Python 3.

\section{Technologies}
this is where we discuss the tools we're using

\subsection{Selenium}
an open source project, meant for testing but used elsewhere, to expose scriptable interactions with web browsers. \citep{holmes2006automating, bruns2009web, razak2011agile, wang2009build, kaur2013comparative, kongsli2007security, artzi2011framework}

\subsection{Python Test Runners}
pytest vs unittest vs nose etc \citep{nielsen2014python, pajankar2017python}
\subsection{Developer Tools and Resources}
Web Inspector, probably others\citep{odell2014browser}

\section{Architecture}
How web application tests are built

\subsection{Page Objects}
object oriented way of encapsulating all the things you can do on one page in a class \citep{liu2000object, kung2000object, leotta2013improving, marchetto2008state}

\subsection{DOM Identifiers And Other Constants}
discussion of how we tie python abstractions to web page elements \citep{gupta2003dom,DOMStand78, nicholus2016understanding}

\subsection{Test Sequences}
how individual tests are built as a sequence of page object actions \citep{leotta2013capture}

\section{Building The Test Suite}
how to build the base test suite for the particular SUT we're discussing. may cite the boilerplate, \citep{GitHubma29}.

\subsection{Planning A Set Of Tests}
walkthrough of how to identify and abstract the list of program features to test, including building a list of actions to write \citep{nguyen2001testing}

\subsection{Determining DOM Object Identifiers}
how to use a web inspector while manually walking through the program

\subsection{Scripting Actions}
how to build the action sequences

\subsection{Asserting Validity}
assert() 101

\subsection{Assembling The Final Test Scripts}
building (and running) a suite
