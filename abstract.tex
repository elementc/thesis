\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract} This work presents a Python software package, Yeager, designed to enable the generation and execution of high-volume automated long-sequence regression tests. Users apply the package to existing suites of automated regression tests by annotating individual test methods as state changes for the Software Under Test. Given a sufficiently connected state model (as inferred from these annotations), it becomes possible to generate and execute configurable random walks through the SUT's various states instead of simple regression suites as originally written.

Divided into three sections, this thesis provides a concise overview of an exemplar regression test suite in Python for a web application, a guide to the usage of Yeager itself within the context of the aforementioned regression test suite, and an overview of the history, anatomy, and family tree of High Volume Automated Testing while contextualizing the contribution Yeager makes to the practice.
